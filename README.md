Danluu:

Solutions and tests for Werner Hett's 99 problems in Scala (http://aperiodic.net/phil/scala/s-99/). The tests are slightly more comprehensive than the other tests I've seen the same problems on github, but they're still very weak.

I'm not sure I'll finish these. I was hoping they'd be a challenge, after doing Odersky's Functional Programming in Scala class, but they seem to be pretty straightforward so far (up to problem 58).

Eyal:

I've made this into a maven project and moved the files to matching package directories so Eclipse will place nice with it if imported. This has been tested on Eclipse Kepler with Scale IDE for Eclipse (verson 4 milestone 1) and ScalaTest for Eclipse (version 2.9.3) and Maven Integration for Eclipse (version 0.4.3)
